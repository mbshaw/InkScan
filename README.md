## Enabling the on screen keybaord with a bluetooth barcode reader

Attaching a Bluetooth barcode reader in HID mode (Acts as a keybaord not a serial input) make the device think there is already a keyboard attached so will not display the screen keyboard when text entry is required. You will need to change settings in the tablet to solve this.
To enable both a BT barcode scanner and the screen keyboard:
* Settings --> General Management
* Tap Language & Input
* Tap Physical Keyboard 
* Select 'Show on-screen keyboard'
